        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Korean Saju Guide was created by <a href="/authors/saju-team">The Saju Guide Team</a> with a simple yet profound mission: to share the fascinating cultural tradition of Saju (사주/四柱) with English-speaking audiences around the world. We believe that this ancient system of self-understanding deserves to be explored, appreciated, and respected as a valuable part of Korean cultural heritage.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform provides educational resources and interactive tools that help you explore the world of Korean Four Pillars:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Saju Calculator:</strong> Generate your personal Four Pillars chart based on your birth information</li>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          We approach Saju with respect for its cultural origins and an understanding of its proper context:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cultural Education:</strong> We present Saju as a traditional knowledge system, not as fortune-telling or supernatural prediction</li>
          <li><strong>Self-Reflection:</strong> Our tools are designed to encourage personal insight and growth, not deterministic life decisions</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy-First:</strong> All calculations happen in your browser—we never store your personal birth data</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We're clear about what Saju can and cannot do</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>
          Saju has been practiced in Korea for centuries, with roots tracing back to Chinese philosophical traditions. It's a system that combines cosmological principles, temporal cycles, and the theory of Five Elements to create a framework for understanding personality traits, life patterns, and interpersonal dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          In modern Korea, Saju remains a popular form of cultural practice, often consulted for personal reflection, relationship insights, and life transitions. We aim to present this tradition authentically while making it accessible to international audiences.
