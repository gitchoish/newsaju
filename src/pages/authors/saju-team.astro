        <h2>Expertise and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Korean Saju Guide Team is a collective of researchers and content curators with a deep passion for Korean cultural traditions. Our members come from various backgrounds, including East Asian studies, cultural anthropology, and digital education.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pride ourselves on our meticulous approach to documenting Saju (Four Pillars of Destiny). By cross-referencing traditional texts with modern interpretations, we aim to provide an accessible yet authentic portal into this profound knowledge system.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Editorial Standards</h2>
        <p>
          Every piece of content on this platform goes through a rigorous review process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cultural Accuracy:</strong> We ensure that terminology and concepts (like the Five Elements and Ten Gods) are presented in alignment with traditional Korean practices.</li>
          <li><strong>Educational Focus:</strong> We strictly avoid deterministic "fortune-telling" claims, focusing instead on the self-reflective and psychological aspects of the practice.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> We translate complex cosmological concepts into clear, modern English without losing the original essence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Commitment to Ethical Practice</h2>
        <p>
          We understand that astrology-related content requires a high degree of responsibility. Our team is committed to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Promoting Saju as a tool for personal growth and cultural appreciation.</li>
          <li>Deterring users from making major life decisions based solely on chart readings.</li>
          <li>Maintaining a "Privacy-First" approach, ensuring no personal birth data is ever stored on our servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Connect With Us</h2>
