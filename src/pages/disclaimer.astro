        <h2>Nature of Saju</h2>
        <p>
          Saju (Korean Four Pillars) is a traditional cultural practice with deep historical roots in Korean and East Asian philosophy. It is a system of interpretation based on cosmological principles and should be understood as a cultural tradition—not as a scientifically validated method of prediction or analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          We present Saju content as a way to explore Korean cultural heritage and as a tool for personal reflection. We do not claim that Saju can accurately predict the future or definitively determine personality traits.
        </p>

        <h2>Responsible Use</h2>
        <p>
          We encourage you to approach Saju with an open but critical mind. Use it as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A cultural learning experience</li>
          <li>A starting point for self-reflection</li>
          <li>An interesting way to explore personality concepts</li>
          <li>A fun activity to share with friends and family</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Do NOT use it as:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A definitive guide to your life path</li>
          <li>A basis for major life decisions</li>
          <li>A replacement for professional advice</li>
          <li>Evidence of predetermined destiny</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Beware of Scams</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, some unethical practitioners may use Saju or similar practices to exploit vulnerable people. Be wary of anyone who:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Claims to know your exact future</li>
          <li>Pressures you to pay for "curse removal" or "luck enhancement"</li>
          <li>Uses fear-based language to encourage payment</li>
          <li>Makes absolute predictions about health, relationships, or finances</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our tools are free to use, and we will never ask for payment to "fix" or "improve" your Saju.
        </p>

        <h2>Cultural Sensitivity</h2>
        <p>
          We approach Saju with respect for its Korean cultural origins. While we aim to make this tradition accessible to international audiences, we acknowledge that our presentation may not capture all nuances understood by traditional practitioners.
        </p>
