        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> This information is processed entirely within your browser. We do NOT store, transmit, or have access to your personal birth data on any server. All calculations happen locally on your device.
        </p>

        <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>
          Like most websites, we may automatically collect certain technical information when you visit our site:

        <p>
          This information is collected through cookies and similar technologies for analytics purposes only.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use collected information to:</p>
        <ul>

        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We may use third-party services that collect information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> For website traffic analysis</li>
          <li><strong>Google AdSense:</strong> For displaying advertisements (if applicable)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These services have their own privacy policies governing their use of your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>

          <li>Data portability</li>
        </ul>
