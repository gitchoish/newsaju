Understanding Saju requires familiarity with several key terms rooted in East Asian philosophy. This glossary provides clear definitions for the essential vocabulary you'll encounter on your journey.

## Core Concepts

### Saju (사주 / 四柱)
Literally "Four Pillars." It refers to the four components of a birth chart: the Year, Month, Day, and Hour pillars.

### BaZi (八字)
Literally "Eight Characters." This is another name for Saju, as each of the four pillars consists of two characters (a Heavenly Stem and an Earthly Branch), totaling eight.

### Yin and Yang (음양 / 陰陽)
The fundamental principle of duality in the universe. In Saju, every element and stem has a Yin or Yang polarity, representing different qualities of energy (e.g., active vs. receptive).

## The Building Blocks

### Heavenly Stems (천간 / 天干)
The ten celestial energies used in Saju. They represent the "ideal" or "heavenly" aspect of a person's life and identity.

### Earthly Branches (지지 / 地支)
The twelve terrestrial energies, often associated with the zodiac animals. They represent the "manifested" or "physical" aspect of life.

### Five Elements (오행 / 五行)
The five phases of energy: Wood (목), Fire (화), Earth (토), Metal (금), and Water (수). Every component in a Saju chart is associated with one of these elements.

## Identity & Personality

### Day Master (일간 / 日干)
The Heavenly Stem of the day you were born. This is considered the single most important character in your chart, representing your core identity and "self."

### Ten Gods (십성 / 十星)
A system used to describe the relationships between the Day Master and the other characters in the chart. The Ten Gods provide insight into career, family, and social dynamics.

### Manse-ryeok (만세력 / 萬歲曆)
The traditional calendar used to convert birth dates into the Four Pillars. Historically a physical book, it is now often implemented as digital software.

## Analytical Terms

### Clash (충 / 沖)
An interaction between pillars that suggests tension or dynamic change. While often viewed cautiously, clashes can also represent opportunities for breakthrough.

### Harmony (합 / 合)
An interaction where elements or branches combine, suggesting stability, cooperation, or the emergence of new qualities.

### Useful God (용신 / 用神)
The element or energy that is most beneficial for balancing a specific Saju chart. Identifying the Useful God is a key goal of traditional Saju analysis.
