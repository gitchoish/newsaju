## The Heart of Your Chart

In Saju (Korean Four Pillars), the **Day Master** (일간/日干, Ilgan) is the Heavenly Stem of your Day Pillar—and it's considered the most important single element of your entire chart. While all four pillars contribute to a complete picture, the Day Master represents who you fundamentally are.

Think of it this way: if your Four Pillars were a solar system, the Day Master would be the sun around which everything else orbits.

## Why the Day Master Matters

### It Represents You

The Day Master is *you* in your chart. Other elements are interpreted in relation to it:
- How elements support or challenge your Day Master
- What resources you naturally have
- What you need for balance

### It Defines Your Core Element

Every Day Master belongs to one of the Five Elements, giving you a fundamental elemental identity:
- **Wood** Day Masters: Growth-oriented, creative, initiating
- **Fire** Day Masters: Passionate, inspiring, transformative
- **Earth** Day Masters: Stable, nurturing, grounding
- **Metal** Day Masters: Structured, principled, refined
- **Water** Day Masters: Adaptive, wise, flowing

### It Includes Yin/Yang Polarity

Beyond the element, your Day Master has Yang (양) or Yin (음) polarity:
- Yang stems express their element actively, outwardly
- Yin stems express their element receptively, inwardly

## Day Master Strength

Beyond which element you are, practitioners assess whether your Day Master is "strong" or "weak" based on:

### Factors That Strengthen

- Same-element presence in other pillars
- Elements that generate your element
- Born in a season that supports your element
- Multiple supporting elements

### Factors That Weaken

- Controlling elements present
- Few supporting elements
- Born in a challenging season
- Many draining relationships in chart

### What Strength Means

A **strong Day Master** suggests:
- Self-reliance
- Clear sense of identity
- Less need for external support
- May need controlling elements for balance

A **weak Day Master** suggests:
- Benefits from support
- More adaptable to circumstances
- Needs resources and help
- May need generating elements for balance

Neither is inherently better—they suggest different life approaches.

## Day Master Relationships

Your Day Master's element creates specific relationships with the other elements:

| Relationship | Element | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Peer | Same as Day Master | Collaborators, competitors |
| Output | Generated by Day Master | Creativity, expression, children |
| Wealth | Controlled by Day Master | Resources you can utilize |
| Power | Controls Day Master | Authority, pressure, structure |
| Resource | Generates Day Master | Support, learning, nurturing |

These relationships form the basis for understanding how different chart elements affect you.
