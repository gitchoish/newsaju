## The Ten Gods System

The Ten Gods (십신/十神, Sipshin) is a sophisticated system for understanding how different elements in your chart relate to your Day Master. Rather than just identifying elements as "wood" or "fire," the Ten Gods describe what role each element plays in relationship to you.

This system transforms abstract elemental analysis into practical insights about personality, relationships, and life patterns.

## How Ten Gods Work

Every element in your chart is classified based on:
1. **What element it is** relative to your Day Master
2. **Whether it shares your polarity** (Yin/Yang)

This creates ten distinct categories—the Ten Gods.

## The Five Relationship Types

### 1. Peer/Parallel (비겁/比劫)

Elements that are **the same as your Day Master**.

- **Rob Wealth (비견/比肩)**: Same element, same polarity
- **Friend (겁재/劫財)**: Same element, opposite polarity

These represent siblings, peers, competitors, and collaborators.

### 2. Output/Expression (식상/食傷)

Elements that your Day Master **generates** (produces).

- **Eating God (식신/食神)**: Generated element, same polarity as Day Master
- **Hurting Officer (상관/傷官)**: Generated element, opposite polarity

These represent creativity, expression, children, and communication.

### 3. Wealth (재성/財星)

Elements that your Day Master **controls** (overcomes).

- **Proper Wealth (정재/正財)**: Controlled element, opposite polarity
- **Indirect Wealth (편재/偏財)**: Controlled element, same polarity

These represent resources, money, and (traditionally) spouse for men.

### 4. Power/Authority (관성/官星)

Elements that **control your Day Master**.

- **Direct Officer (정관/正官)**: Controlling element, opposite polarity
- **Seven Killings (편관/七殺)**: Controlling element, same polarity

These represent authority, career, pressure, and (traditionally) spouse for women.

### 5. Resource/Support (인성/印星)

Elements that **generate your Day Master**.

- **Direct Seal (정인/正印)**: Generating element, opposite polarity
- **Indirect Seal (편인/偏印)**: Generating element, same polarity

These represent education, support, nurturing, and mother figures.

## Analyzing Your Chart

When interpreting Ten Gods in a chart:

1. **Identify all elements** in your four (or eight) characters
2. **Classify each** according to its relationship to your Day Master
3. **Note which gods are prominent** (appearing frequently)
4. **Note which are absent** (missing from visible chart)
5. **Consider the balance** of the different god categories

## Practical Applications

The Ten Gods help explain:
- **Career suitability**: Strong Officers suggest traditional careers; strong Expression gods suggest creative paths
- **Relationship patterns**: Wealth and Power gods relate to partnership dynamics
- **Personal challenges**: Prominent "challenging" aspects indicate growth areas
- **Life themes**: Which gods dominate tells a story about life focus

## Important Caveats  

### This Is Complex

Ten Gods analysis is one of the more advanced areas of Saju. Full interpretation requires considering:
- Combinations and interactions
- Season and strength
- Hidden elements
- Life timing

### Not Deterministic

These are tendencies and potentials, not fixed fates. Your choices matter more than any chart element.

### Cultural Context

Some traditional Ten Gods interpretations carry cultural assumptions (especially regarding gender roles) that may not apply to modern life or personal situations.
