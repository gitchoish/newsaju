## Understanding Earthly Branches

The Twelve Earthly Branches (지지/地支, Jiji) represent the terrestrial counterpart to the Heavenly Stems. While stems represent celestial qi, branches represent how that energy manifests on Earth. Each branch is associated with an animal, a two-hour period of the day, a month, and specific elemental qualities.

In Korean culture, most people know their birth year's zodiac animal from the Twelve Branches—but in Saju, branches appear in all four pillars, providing much richer information.
