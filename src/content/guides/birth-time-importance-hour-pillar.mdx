## The Fourth Pillar

In a complete Saju reading, you have four pillars: Year, Month, Day, and Hour. While you can calculate three pillars from just your birth date, the Hour Pillar requires knowing when you were born—ideally within a two-hour window.

Many people don't know their exact birth time, which raises important questions: How crucial is it? What are you missing without it? Can you still get value from Saju?

## What the Hour Pillar Reveals

### Inner World and Hidden Self

The Hour Pillar (시주/時柱) represents aspects of your personality that may not be immediately visible:

- Your private thoughts and inner motivations
- How you behave when completely comfortable
- Subconscious patterns and instincts
- Your relationship with your own potential

While the Day Pillar shows your core identity (how you fundamentally are), the Hour Pillar shows what lies beneath that—your inner landscape.

### Children and Legacy

Traditionally, the Hour Pillar is associated with:

- Relationship with children
- What you leave behind
- Later life (approximately ages 45+)
- Long-term goals and aspirations

### Completing the Picture

Without the Hour Pillar, you're missing:
- 2 out of 8 characters in your full chart
- Important element balance information
- Interactions between the Hour and other pillars
- A full understanding of your inner dynamics

## The Twelve Two-Hour Periods

Saju divides the day into twelve two-hour periods, each governed by an Earthly Branch:

| Period | Branch | Animal | Hours |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 子 (Ja) | Rat | 23:00-01:00 |
| 2 | 丑 (Chuk) | Ox | 01:00-03:00 |
| 3 | 寅 (In) | Tiger | 03:00-05:00 |
| 4 | 卯 (Myo) | Rabbit | 05:00-07:00 |
| 5 | 辰 (Jin) | Dragon | 07:00-09:00 |
| 6 | 巳 (Sa) | Snake | 09:00-11:00 |
| 7 | 午 (O) | Horse | 11:00-13:00 |
| 8 | 未 (Mi) | Goat | 13:00-15:00 |
| 9 | 申 (Sin) | Monkey | 15:00-17:00 |
| 10 | 酉 (Yu) | Rooster | 17:00-19:00 |
| 11 | 戌 (Sul) | Dog | 19:00-21:00 |
| 12 | 亥 (Hae) | Pig | 21:00-23:00 |

### The Special Case of Midnight

The Rat hour (子時) spans midnight, running from 23:00 of one day to 01:00 of the next. This creates a traditional debate:

- **Zi Shi (子時) split**: Some practitioners split this period at midnight
- **Traditional view**: Others treat it as one continuous period

This mainly matters if you were born very close to midnight.

## How to Find Your Birth Time

### Official Records

In many countries, birth time is recorded on:
- Birth certificates
- Hospital records
- Health records

In Korea, birth time has traditionally been important, so older birth records often include it.

### Family Memory

Ask family members, particularly:
- Your mother (most likely to remember)
- Other relatives who were present
- Check baby books or journals

Even approximate times ("early morning," "around dinner time") can narrow it to a two-hour window.

### Hospital Records

If you were born in a hospital, they may have more detailed records than what appears on your birth certificate. It's worth requesting complete birth records.

## What If You Don't Know Your Birth Time?

### Working with Three Pillars

A three-pillar reading still provides significant insight:

- **Year Pillar**: Social persona, family background
- **Month Pillar**: Career, early adulthood
- **Day Pillar**: Core identity, marriage

The Day Pillar alone—particularly your Day Master—offers substantial information about your fundamental nature.

### Rectification

Some advanced practitioners offer "rectification"—attempting to determine birth time by:
- Analyzing known life events
- Comparing personality to different hour possibilities
- Using other timing techniques

This is speculative and should be approached carefully.

### Accept the Unknown

There's value in accepting what we don't know. A three-pillar reading is still meaningful, and forcing an uncertain Hour Pillar might introduce inaccuracies.

## Timezone Considerations

### Historical Time Zones

Birth time should be converted to the local time that was in use when and where you were born. This can be complicated by:

- **Daylight Saving Time**: Was DST in effect?
- **Historical timezone changes**: Some regions have changed time zones
- **War time**: Some countries used different times during wartime

### Korea Specifically

Korea has used different timezones historically:
- Before 1908: Local solar time
- 1908-1954: Various changes
- Since 1954: KST (UTC+9), with brief exceptions

If you were born in Korea before 1954, timezone research may be needed.

### Converting to True Solar Time

Some traditional practitioners convert to "true solar time" based on longitude. Most modern calculators use standard timezone time, which is generally acceptable for self-reflection purposes.

## Hour Pillar and Other Pillars

### Harmony and Conflict

The Hour Branch can form harmonies or conflicts with other branches in your chart:

- **Harmony with Day Branch**: Internal peace and integration
- **Conflict with Day Branch**: Inner tension, complex personality
- **Year-Hour relationships**: How your inner self relates to your social expression

### Element Balance Impact

Two more elements from the Hour Pillar affect your overall balance. For example:
- If you lack Water in your three pillars, an Hour Pillar containing Water would change the picture
- Strong element patterns are affected by Hour Pillar additions

## Practical Advice

### For Complete Readings

If you know your birth time:
1. Convert to the timezone used at your birthplace
2. Account for any Daylight Saving Time
3. Use a reliable calculator that handles timezones

### For Unknown Birth Times

If you don't know:
1. Calculate your three-pillar chart
2. Read interpretations for Day Master (still very relevant)
3. Consider the Hour Pillar as "unknown" rather than guessing
4. Accept that some aspects are mysteries

### Don't Obsess

Remember: Saju is for self-reflection, not prediction. A complete chart is nice to have, but your life isn't determined by whether you know your birth hour. Many people find profound value in three-pillar readings.
