## What Are Heavenly Stems?

The Ten Heavenly Stems (천간/天干, Cheongan) represent celestial energies that cycle through time. Together with the Twelve Earthly Branches, they form the 60-year cycle (육십갑자) that is fundamental to Korean and Chinese calendar systems.

Each Heavenly Stem has a distinct character that combines:
- An element (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, or Water)
- A polarity (Yin or Yang)

When you know someone's Day Stem (the Heavenly Stem of their Day Pillar), you gain insight into their core personality—their Day Master.

## The Wood Stems

### 甲 (Gap/갑) - Yang Wood

**The Pioneer / The Great Tree**

Gap represents the mighty tree—tall, straight, and reaching for the sky. Like an oak that stands firm through storms, Gap individuals have a strong sense of direction and natural leadership qualities.

### 乙 (Eul/을) - Yin Wood

**The Diplomat / The Vine**

Eul represents flexible vegetation—the vine that finds its way around obstacles rather than pushing through them. Where Gap is the oak, Eul is the willow, bending with the wind but never breaking.

## The Fire Stems

### 丙 (Byeong/병) - Yang Fire

**The Radiant One / The Sun**

Byeong is the sun itself—bright, warm, and generous with its light. These individuals naturally illuminate any room they enter, spreading warmth and optimism.

- Observant of others' needs
- Humble and service-oriented

**Potential Challenges**:

## The Metal Stems

**The Warrior / The Sword**

Gyeong is forged steel—strong, sharp, and principled. These individuals have a clear sense of right and wrong and the courage to stand for their convictions.

**Personality Traits**:
- Strong sense of justice
- Decisive and action-oriented
- Competitive and driven
- Courageous under pressure
- Direct and honest

**Potential Challenges**:
- Can be confrontational
- May see issues too black-and-white
